The Ludum Dare Team 2020

Greetings wanderer ! Would you gaze into a world where a dodo is performing a rythm/platformer game made by a *watermelon god* ? 
Even if you would not, we invite you in this tiny game of ours, where you will -We hope- find some pleasure and measurement when you will finish this game. The first of our young team "A cordon bleu" !
