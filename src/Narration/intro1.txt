Hey ? Ermmm Hello ? Ahh you're finally hearing me !
I was wondering if I would be able to reach one of your kind at least !
It's been like THREE WHOLE MINUTES that I am experiencing pure loneliness !
My name ? Meehh who cares having a name nowadays ? But if you want,
you can call me Johann. Nah don't tell me yours, you are only numbers to me.
So i'll call you player 1. What did you just said ?
HOW IN THE WORLD PLAYER 1 ISN'T AN ORIGINAL NAME ?
Look, you are like, the first one that I know who have this name !
Ahh... Why was I talking to you already ?
Oh I remember, I have far greater objectives -than having a truly marvelous name- for you.
I would like to show you my view of your universe. With music ! And games !
Why we should not get started with a little warm up ?
Okay so, do you see these strips all over your screen ?
They will help you moving up and down and avoiding obstacles BUT
you can only move in rythm with the beautiful music that I will play now !
Ohhh yeeeaah baby do you feel those funky beats ?
Okay move your body and try to jump over this platform
by pressing KeyUp with the right timing !
