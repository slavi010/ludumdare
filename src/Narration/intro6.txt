Um... Player 1 ? Are you okay ? I mean you've done quite the crash !
It made me remember the last kiwi extinction... oh nevermind.
I have to apologize,I have been a bit too quick with you.
But you know, it's not that bad when you fail ! 
Failure and success is only two parts of this world.
Oh you look confused  ? Are you wondering what is this place ?
Ah yes let me explain to you. I said that failure was a part of this world ?
It was literal ! Welcome in the chill night world !
Here, failure is much appreciated and you are authorized to learn at your own pace !
Pretty cool isn't it ? Now let's try to pass the next obstacle !
